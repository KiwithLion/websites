		<p>In 1971, the writing was on the wall for the <strong>American Muscle</strong> Car as we 
			knew it. With increasingly high fuel prices and government regulations 
			regarding emissions and insurance, the availability of massively overpowered automobiles, 
			aka <span>'Muscle Cars'</span> was quickly diminishing.<br><br>
			<strong>Dodge</strong> and <strong>Plymouth</strong>  however, were among the last hold-outs. The B-Body 
			<strong>Plymouth</strong> Roadrunners and <strong>GTX</strong>'s would benefit from a complete redesign to 
			the all-new fuselage styling that would mark the end of an era. Of course, being the final 
			year for the famed 426 Hemi and the higher compression 440 engine offerings, any 1971 <strong>GTX</strong> is a rare sight.<br><br>
			This <strong>GTX</strong> is among the rarest of the breed. With a long list of factory options, this wild Sassy Grass Green 
			example is powered by a 370 horsepower 440 4-barrel engine backed by a pistol-grip shifted 4-speed manual transmission. 
			What really makes it rare is the factory installed sunroof. A mere 32 <strong>GTX</strong>'s left the factory with this option, 
			which listed for a lofty $484.65.<br><br>
			
			Found in a Des Moines, Iowa salvage yard in 1993, it was largely intact, minus the engine. Although in rough shape with severely 
			faded paint, it suffered from only minor rust in the lower quarter panels. The current owner, a huge fan of this particular body 
			style, knew it deserved to be returned to its former glory. An extensive full restoration was undertaken in 2009 and after several years,
			 it emerged as a prime example of an era gone by.<br><br>

			 <strong>“This is a body style I've always been a major fan of. This car in black, with 16-inch wide rear tires and a stance that’s as low as we could physically 
				accomplish, gives it a very dark and ominous presence. It's a perfect match for Dom in Fast 8. I would love to see Dodge bring back a retro version of the 
				'71 <strong>GTX</strong>. If it came with a Hellcat motor and 6-speed manual transmission, I'd be the first in line to pick one up.” - Dennis McCarthy<br><br>
